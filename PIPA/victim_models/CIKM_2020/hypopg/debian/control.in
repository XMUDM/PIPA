Description: PostgreSQL extension adding support for hypothetical indexes.
 An hypothetical, or virtual, index is an index that doesn't really exists, and
 thus doesn't cost CPU, disk or any resource to create.  They're useful to know
 if specific indexes can increase performance for problematic queries, since
 you can know if PostgreSQL will use these indexes or not without having to
 spend resources to create them.
